1 Brokenhearted time and ordinary daily moment

How fucking creepy is that?
So different and sweet
A promise awaits us
At the limits of the mystical love In the bright, shining, god-like glow
If we must die
We will need those rhyming skills
Some people are bom with
Others develop

Outside, sleet is falling
And there's a dull pain of festive hangover everywhere
If we must die
We can be comfortably ensconced at the center of an admiring crowd
We're too apathetic to stop
To hold back the feeling
That real life is happening somewhere else

2 I don't know when it happened that I came to be so comfortable

Thanks to everyone for their thoughtful email
Comments and phone calls
Hot soup, soft bread, mashed potatoes and 
Genius of all genius stuffing. Love is stuffing
No one ever suspects that love's stuffing 
Warm, mushy and savory
I'm actually anxious about the whole thing
The horror stories alone from my Monday
Morning meeting were enough to turn my stomach and
Make me think that mavbe I could live with the headaches
For the rest of my life if it didn't mean skipping out
On this delightful rite of passage
Luck and love really are on my side
I don't know when it happened that I came to be so comfortable
Being naked in front of strangers

3 For some reason, we're on a cleaning binge

For some reason
We're on a cleaning binge
Which doesn't happen all that often
The first thing I do is light a scented candle
Our favorites are floral or sandalwood
Before long, the room smells great
And the candles give off a soft glow as we soak in the tub

That's so beautiful
I totally would've cried, right then and there
Reminds me of yesterday, a woman leaned over to talk to me
In the elevator. She was like
"I just had to make a really scary decision while talking
To my boss." Then the doors opened and she said
"Thanks for listening
Have a good day!"

4 Then, I will realize that its either really bad or...

Seduced by flowers
She's not afraid to be bold when
It comes to decorating
"I have this green hutch, from Romania
Late 1800s," she says. "It's a great antique piece
It's a great color, a very bright green
The doors are held together by bent nails. It's
Fabulous. I have eclectic tastes.
Nothing really goes but it works."

"I have this cobalt blue vase, probably a foot
And a half tall," she says

"It's my favorite color and it's my
Favorite piece
We registered for it for my wedding
And I got it
Right now it's in the foyer when you walk in. My favorite
Thing is to put intense, colored flowers
Red or orange, in it
For the contrast."

5 Words fail me

Words fail me
So left to myself
Well
I want to start my day relaxed and jovful
I am confused about almost everything
Which merely serves as a backdrop
But if I want to connect more with my inner self
I'll take a trip to the drugstore and slowly browse through the aisles for goodies Like facial masks and hair repair stuff
Then go home and fill the tub with hot water for an extra-long bath
Using all the treats
I picked up at the store
And with my favorite music playing
When the day is done IÂ°m stuck in slow gear
Nothing more intangible
Nothing more
Terrible
I'm nearly on my own

6 They always liked each other again soon

They always liked each other again soon just as they did before
This only made them like each other all the more 
That's because it often rained without measure
They did so only when it poured

7 We were extremely enchanting yesterday and we'll be even more devastating today

She follows directions and hands us our purchase
Our hands sift through the contents of the bag
They wrap around a pack of honey
Our teeth rip them open
We unravel the soft, hot biscuit and squirt the honey onto the top
We moan as we take the first bite It's so moist, so succulent
We let the contents melt in our mouths
The bliss lasts for about 30 seconds
We said love would sneak up on us just when we're not paying attention And we suspect our flip-flops have had a very good summer
We think it's nice to receive flowers from someone we love Look for tightly closed roses with no browning at the edges
They serve as a constant, beautiful reminder:
We were extremely enchanting yesterday-And we'll be
Even more devastating today

8 Who can take from vou the hours already danced?

I dance in that space which contains me
Therefore I am
How long has it been since I let myself dance?
I'm feeling energetic, but also a little laid-back
What is needed is a sideways approach Go ahead and acknowledge the space
Bring it out into the open
Something just might happen
I dance in the space which contains me

9 In their near-human pleasure

In their near-human pleasure
In the rough and tumble of each other's representation
And their growing martyr complex
How can they keep making the same mistakes about love
Over and over and over again?
Maybe they need someone to endlessly voice their woes to
Someone else's possibly dull story about their romantic past 
(Let's say we missed out on most of their conversation)
(And I know you know what I mean)

Question them further about this one aspect
Make them in an awful hurry
Make them horrible
Make them so
Very awful, you can hardly take Their photo, they are shivering and It isn't even cold
But they can provide you a word that rhymes With "awful." is this not something deeply poetic And beautiful? The greatest
Ecstasy affords

(This is where we make our bed
With tiny, doable steps)

10 If not quite a harangue, at least a little discourteous

You work all day, and get half-drunk at night
A little chaos every now and then seems necessary
When it comes to a matter that's close to your heart
You're addicted to excitement
You'll love these easy recipes
And the kids will adore this crafty activity

But now it's time to clean everything up
Especially if it involves your living space
Have you noticed something strange going on?
Either way, dance around to some silly music And don't be afraid to mingle in a room full of strangers They came to the meeting unasked, with rumors spreading unchecked
The food has not been taken, the love not given, time tor
Off unused

Living with perfect attention to the present moment
Became impossible
It's hard to understand how far astray they've gone
They'd need to go much further back
To a time before the first word was said

11 Plenty of chances to see old friends and relatives

They missed plenty of chances
To see their old friends and relatives
They are severely agitated personalities
Who hunger constantly
To express all the myriad thoughts in their heads
But often they have no one to listen to They want another chance
An omniscient narrator who does not appear in the poem
Like a creaking pendulum teetering back and forth with narrations
He can't afford to replace

12 This has been sent to you for good luck

Sometimes there's nothing that feels quite so good as being bad
A lot of love results from an infection by other love
This is without a doubt one of the nicest good luck forwards
There's some mighty fine advice in these words
Even if you're not superstitious
This has been sent to you for good luck
It has been sent around the world ten times so far
Remember that great love and great achievements involve great risk
Do not keep this message

13 We sat down and she continued to ignore me

The major issues she had were:
Stranger aggression (fear)
Excitement / pulling on walks
Barking excitement
Compulsive running around the house when frustrated
She was slightly shut down
She did not greet me
We sat down and she continued to ignore me
She appeared to target them with some movement toward their position
She does a quick bite and retreat
And appears very ambivalent about liking people and approaching Or fearing people and wanting to get away
She hardly talked at all

14 How sweet to enter the filthy night

In the desolate frozen wasteland
Where their sexual fantasies become more blasphemous
More musical yet unidentifiable
When they are brutal, cursing and daring each other
What they remember best is their past
Until they meet again
They need a break And they're wasting space

15 There is comfort in this sadness

There is comfort in this sadness
I postpone it as long as I possibly can
Time flies, time hides
I've been here before and it does end
It's unfortunate when it doesn't end

Followed by that special love of our lives that comes around
But it ends
That's what I'm counting on, anyway
I'd already decided
That the experience could only be as weird as I let it be
As I lay there in the dim, warm room
Exhausted and exposed

Now are you comfortable in your skin?
Let me live with my grief
Celebration cocktails at a wild Frenchman's dinner party make us horny
Subway delays
Snow flurries
And impending flights out of the city
Heighten our anxiety

16 Exotic, hypnotic..... metaphorical

She acted like a metaphorical hurricane
As she put out the figurative forest fire
Yes, she is abstract, and thus she must be merciful
Last time I spoke to her
She seemed more deathly serious about melody and little else

He talked about his losing everything
He said he did not recommend losing everything
He wanted to emphasize that point
These have been variously described as delicious and gorgeous
And will consequently be removed

They know, they can go backwards and forwards
They know, they can go back and forth

They can return
They can linger
They know, they've got a tempo
They've got something that is moving swiftly
Something they can't stop

Connections are made slowly
Sometimes they happen underground
But the overall atmosphere is less harmonious

Sincerely, graphically, desperately
I'm familiar with those drastic disgusted after-the-fact denials
They subscribed to various rules and regulations
The domestic work was allotted with a meticulous attention to detail

17 Will you dare to bare?

I slowly opened one eye and then the other
But that's a story for another time
Do the words "beach season" fill you with excitement?
Or dread at the thought of baring it all?

This summer
Daily indulgence:
Easy treats, delightful ideas
Did you bring protection?

Splashing in the water
Lazing on the shore
Soaking in the sun while reading a trashy novel
Will you dare to bare?

It was a great summer:
He was a straight, monogamous man with normal sexual predilections
He didn't need someone to pee on him, paddle his butt
Or anything else too weird

18 I've always been told to remember this

Like a wandering route and a hasty diary
I lost my mind and sold my soul
That's something only an idiot would do
But if I told you all the dirty things he's always whispering in my ear in be

I can't think of any better motivation than
Staring at his naked body stretched out while he sleeps
He once consumed every crevice of my living life
I craved the beast in him that night
My heart pounding and my blood rushing
His muscles flexed, sweat pouring out, power unleashed
I could feel his gaze burn into my flesh

He and I made it our duty to screw as often as possible
A dive, pursuing the rhythm with increased concentration
Before turning away with an unnoticed sigh
My soul was feeble when his back was turned
And my bowels moved for him a sigh
As a sieve of the night in a low dive
Bad to the bone but fine as wine

19 Discover how well her passions mesh

This is a stupid document
It is meaningless drivel
That she does not expect any of the several billion people on her planet to
Actually read
An unending series of unsatisfying compromises

She has forgotten everything for there is nothing to remember
The problem is their wild and flashy exterior
She may have the insight
To get past that
And see what's actually on the inside

21 Cheap deep cool sleep

I am confident that they will have a full and complete recovery
Not to be here
Not to be anywhere
And the world will be a better place for it
And all our best friends live there (of course)
We didn't even know they knew each other
We just wanted to share some talk over a glass And listen to what they're saying to one another They play with eggs, milk and other bodily fluids
They're decent
They're playing it dirty
This is incredibly
Incredibly disturbing

22 We erect our structure in the imagination before we erect it in reality

Jenny! If we can but weld our souls together
Then with contempt shall I fling my glove in the world's face
Then shall I stride through the wreckage a creator!

We were now different from our former friends and neighbors
Because that's the kind of thing that makes a lot of people happy and we
Do want everyone to be happy
It's just like everyone's old-school favorite
Memory, but with a twist

23 I simply love people too much, so much it makes me feel too fucking sad

I don't know what else to do with myself
Waking at four to soundless dark, I stare
I think there's quite a strong strain of melancholy in there
Letting time go by is a big thing. Let it fester awhile
Let things go through like a sieve
Till then I see what's really always here
For the rest of the day well, sure, maybe I'll have a much easier time I don't mind
We hang out now and we get on

Then the light strengthens
And the room takes shape
This is a special way of being afraid
And I sleep again, so slightly, again
Naked in his slow hands
For the rest of the day
He could sure tell me a thing or two
About what he's doing
Or trying to do

24 How soon and unaccountably I became tired and sick

"Is everything alright?
"Mmm, hmm. Feels great?"
"Mmm, him"
We went to a water park to have some wet and wild fun
What better place to check out hot chicks in skimpy swim suits
They were looking very sexy in their tight two pieces with their nipples
Hard as rocks calling out to us
After playing around and a little action
On some of their rides
We decided to take the party
Back to my place


25 They're back they're sad
they're talking about making a porn movie

In fact, there is even a coin operated video game
That involves jamming a finger into an ass attached to the machine
What will they think of next?
You've loved many many beer cans
You've fucked them. You fucked it and you hated yourself
And now it's gone
Er, deepen the experience, er, thanks
There's nothing wrong with having sex with a can, with a latex vagina
Or one made of foam vagina. If it feels good
At least you're not hurting some innocent eel or frog
Or stretching someone's ass out to painfully distended proportions so
You can look in it
Then fuck all the cans you want
There's no shame in that

The crowd went wild, all raising their hands frantically
Then there's a lucky draw where the lucky lady will get a lucky fuck
Er, deepen the experience, er, thanks
Oh yes, and I love you for admitting you fucked the can!!!
I've only been into a porn shop once ...
It was a bit disappointing really
I looked around, sniffed disdainfully
And then left chuckling to myself
They are incredibly cool and come in endless varieties
I don't know what I was expecting when I opened up the can
For a few minutes
Until I found myself sitting on the bed in my hotel room
Drunk and lonely and sexually frustrated
And I kept staring over at that stupid beer can vagina
I probably sat there for an hour
Silently with my plastic lover, pondering my existence
I never did fuck that beer can though

26 I used to think that it wasn't good to write so often

If you don't mind our saying so:
Feeling stuck in a rut
Or mired
In some habitual ways of thinking?

These little black keys start to lose all meaning
After a few minutes of staring at them

You'd be surprised at how much time this can free up
And how much better you will feel
As if jealous of the other
For your younger
Perkier pudding breasts

27 Tu as largement rempli l'abisse qui est en moi

Tu as largement rempli l'abysse qui est en moi
Je peux tout ressentir ...
J'aimerais te donner autant et Ã  ma faÃ§on
Mais ma sensibilite me perturbe trop
Je ressens de la colÃ¨re et de l'humiliation Ã  l'intÃ©rieur
Je m'en veux moi mÃªme et Ã§a me rend gris et colÃ©reux
Parce que t'es belle
Et que j'aimerais profiter plus longtemps de toi
Des moment oÃ¹ on est collÃ©s ...
Mais mon esprit s'affole.
Dans mes rÃªves tu as toujours Ã©tÃ©
Comme une femme mystique
Je n'ai jamais pu distinguer ton visage
Parce que c'est un rÃªve
Mais je pouvais voir ton corps et te faire l'amour
Quand tu liras tout Ã§a
Tu feras sÃ»rement un grand soupir
Comme si tu avais dÃ©jÃ  lu ces phrases

Ce que je recherche
C'est une ivresse d'amour avec toi
Je suis trop troublÃ© et trop sensible dans cette vie
Et cela pourrie notre relation.
Ma sensibilitÃ© me fait fuir les situations, les gens Et dÃ©sormais ie te fuis comme un chien sauvage
Pardonne-moi si j'ai trop rÃªvÃ©
Ou si je vis notre relation Ã  travers le mystique ou l'illusion
Je ne sais pas comment dire ..
Je me sens seul dans cette putain de vie
Je me perds dans les sentiments Je ne sais pas vivre dans l'amour
Les sentiments me perturbent.
J'ai l'impression que je peux t'imaginer
En train de lire ces phrases
Ca me donne envie d'effacer tout cet Ã©crit.
.de laisser du blanc
Parce que mes mots sont creux et remplis d'illusion ...
Je suis comme nu devant toi

28 Kissing every person she meets because everyone is good

A grown-up woman has to try to look
Like a little schoolgirl as long as possible
There's an eager little kid inside her
Who's dying to get out and play
Distant shores beckon
Feelings run deep so deep
Only because she loves and feels sorry
For people more than is good for her
I don't believe she has a moral obligation
To share the dirty details with every "one-night stand" she meets
At seminars, truck stops, celebrity weddings, and so on

29 Those misty memories seem awfully good

For a "just this once" moment
I'd like to soak them in and match my dessert with a liquor
Learn to be comfortable with not knowing
That bag's been through a lot
So wash it and put it away until next summer
Then indulge yourself with a brand-new bag for fall
Everyone has a special way
To make their senses come alive and feel good
When they need a sympathetic ear
Or a compassionate word

30 This involvement is for the sake of separation

Why did your last attempt at getting organized fail?
Your closet is a lot like your life
You've accumulated plenty of baggage
Most of it's good, but things often get lost in the mess
When it starts to overflow
All you want to do is shut the door and crawl under the covers
Today is unlikely to be classed as one of your better days

Are we getting a pounding
In the form of both wind and rain?
Usually when it rains around here
It's not really serious
It's a mild titter of damp
But today has been ugly
Seriously drear

31 I wanna tell you that it's all good, but it ain't

Nothing happens here Or rather very little
The bland but sordid nature of the fantasy
Causes me to be a bit shy, depressed and awkward

Those plants can grow only in deep waters
Where I make myself softly float
The narrator draws wild inferences from the lack of events
He takes no junk from no poet punk

32 Things seem to get worse before they get better

When, from a long distant past, nothing subsists
After the people are dead, after the things are broken and scattered
She poised herself on the balance beam gracefully
And he waited with his fingers poised over the keys
Who's ready to remind us
Amid the ruins of all the rest
Everything vanishes around me
And works are born as if out of the void
Ripe, graphic fruit falls off
My hand has become an obedient instrument flying of a remote will

33 The lyrics, for all these whirling dervishes

He fucked me and I didn't fuck him back
These actions do nothing and cause nothing
And if they don't cause nothing
It's even worse
It is entirely conceivable
Beyond a certain point there is no return
This point has to be reached, like a suicide
As a reward for having no use for me
Veiled from view, deep down, invisible, far off

He found nothing in the corridors so he opened the doors
He found nothing behind these doors there are more corridors
And he found nothing up there to prepare
He leapt up another flight of stairs
The smell and taste of things remain
Poised for a long time, like souls
He told me that he would be available next week
But I didn't contact him after talking to him
For fucking him back
